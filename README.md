The project is based on the data cleaning and EDA

I have taken the data set called layoffs from kaggle and performed the EDA on it.
I found that the google, amazon, facebook...etc big companies made many layoffs and the most people are effected in the countries like United States and India..

Some important steps need to be done while cleaning the data cleaning they are,

1.Delete Duplicates
2.Data Standardizing
3.Dealing or removing the null values
4.Removing unwanted columns.
